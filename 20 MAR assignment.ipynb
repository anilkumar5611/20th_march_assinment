    "#Data encoding, also known as data transformation or data representation, refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. In the context of data science, data encoding is particularly important when dealing with categorical variables, which are variables that represent categories or labels rather than numerical values.\n",

    "#Numerical representation: Many machine learning algorithms and statistical models require numerical inputs. Categorical variables, such as gender (male/female), product types (A/B/C), or color (red/green/blue), cannot be directly used as inputs in most models.
